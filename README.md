# Charged Particle Simulation with PINN, PNN and SympNet

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to model the trajectory of a charged particle based on the physical laws governing its motion, then simulate and visualize this trajectory.
This project involves predicting the future states of a charged particle in an electromagnetic field using various neural network models, namely SympNets, PNNs (Poisson Neural Networks), and PINNs (Physics-Informed Neural Networks). Below is a summary of the tasks outlined:

- **Objective:** Predict the future states of a charged particle given its trajectory data using different neural networks.
- **Governing Equations:** The motion of the particle is governed by the Lorentz force and can be described by the equation:
### Governing Equation

The motion of a charged particle in an electromagnetic field is governed by the equation:

\[ m \ddot{x} = q \left( E + \dot{x} \times B \right) \]

where:
- \( m \) is the mass,
- \( q \) is the electric charge,
- \( x \) is the particle's position,
- \( E \) is the electric field,
- \( B \) is the magnetic field.

### Dataset

- The dataset includes velocity \( v \) and position \( x \) data for 1500 time points, generated by a Stormer–Verlet integrator.
- The data is provided in `train.txt` and `test.txt` files.
- **Initial State:** \( v_0 = (1, 0.5, 0) \) and \( x_0 = (0.5, 1, 0) \).
- The system reduces to a 2D dynamics problem, focusing on the first two dimensions.

## How to Run the Project

### 1. Data Preparation
Before training, ensure you have the necessary data in the `data/` directory. If needed, you can modify the data preprocessing steps in the code.

### 2. Train the Model
To train the SympNet model on the charged particle dataset:
run the jupyter Notebook 

The model will be saved in the `models/` directory after training.

### 3. Simulate Particle Trajectory
To simulate the trajectory of a charged particle using the trained model:


This will generate a series of images representing the particle's motion over time, saved in the `simulation_video/` directory.

### 4. Create a Video
Once the simulation is complete, you can create a video from the generated frames using the notebook

This will save the video in the `outputs/` directory as `particle_trajectory.mp4`.


## Visualization

During the simulation, the particle's trajectory is visualized as it moves through the magnetic field. After running the simulation, you can check the `outputs/` directory for both the images and the final video showcasing the particle's motion.

## Results

After training, the SympNet model achieves a low Mean Squared Error (MSE) on the test data, indicating accurate prediction of the particle's trajectory. The final video visualizes the predicted trajectory based on this learned model.
